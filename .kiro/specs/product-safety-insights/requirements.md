# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Product Safety Insights feature provides cosmetic users with a simple and reliable way to check product safety and approval status. This feature empowers users to make informed decisions about cosmetic products by surfacing trusted safety information, understanding risks, and discovering safer alternatives. The system will integrate with cosmetic safety databases to provide real-time product status information and help users avoid harmful items while building confidence in their beauty routines.

6. WHEN displaying risk indicators THEN the system SHALL ensure accessibility compliance with proper color contrast and screen reader support

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to understand why a product was approved or cancelled (e.g., harmful ingredient found) so I can make better choices in the future.
